## Overview

Rent prices in Istanbul can vary significantly based on region and apartment features. This project aims to build a predictive model that can help estimate monthly rental costs using historical data scraped or collected from real estate listings.

The notebook covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Training regression models  
- Model evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

- **Location** (district/neighborhood)  
- **Square meters**  
- **Number of rooms**  
- **Floor**  
- **Building age**  
- **Heating type**  
- **Price (target variable)**

> Note: The dataset may be sourced from web scraping or a CSV file. If itâ€™s not included in the repo, please add your own dataset in the expected format.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- XGBoost or other regressors (optional)
